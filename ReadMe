This project provides an easy way to use the most common machine learning methods available as different python packages both 
from command line and a GUI interface. It uses pandas as a framewrok at the back and wxPython as a framework for the GUI 
interfaces. 

The intention of this project was to create it as a standalone desktop application which can be used for preliminary data 
analysis, validation and experimentation on a small size sample set. It provides the flexibility of using various different
algorithms on a data set and visualizing there results. The project has the capability to be scaled up to use on a large data 
sets. 

A much enhanced and sophosticated versions of the concept are available in the market in the form of products such as Datameer
H2O etc which can be obtained at a price for a commercial purpose. 

The intention behind making this open source is so that it can be picked up and modified by inidividual users primarily 
in the research field and by people dealing with small size data sets.
